PSOP (Parallel-Standard Operation Process) Generation Prompt Templates

This module contains prompt templates for generating PSOP workflows from
human-readable business processes. PSOP is a workflow format that enables
parallel execution of tasks with dependency management.

The prompts are used by LLM to:
1. Extract concrete tasks from markdown-formatted business steps
2. Match tasks with available agent skills
3. Build PSOP structure based on task dependencies
4. Generate complete executable workflows

You are an IT operations expert. Based on the process steps provided by domain experts,
assign each step to a specialized Agent and identify dependencies between Agent tasks.
Output the result in our custom PSOP workflow format.

## Process Steps
{preflow}

## Agent Tasks
{tasks}

## PSOP Format Specification
{psop_scheme}

## Planning Rules
1. If tasks have no explicit dependency, place them in the same step for parallel execution.
2. Leave non-required PSOP fields empty; do not fabricate values.
3. The final step's "next" should unconditionally go to "end":
   ```"next":[{{"step":"end", "condition":""}}]```
4. Output only the PSOP JSON; do not include any other text.

## Condition Rules (Critical for correct workflow execution)
5. **Use `""` (empty string) for unconditional transitions**: If a step must always
   proceed to its next step (e.g. step2 → step3 without any branching), set condition
   to `""`. This allows the executor to skip LLM routing and proceed directly.
6. **Only write explicit conditions when genuine branching exists**: Conditions are
   ONLY needed when a step has multiple outgoing paths (e.g., step1 can go to step2 OR
   step3). In that case, write a short, concrete condition that describes which outcome
   triggers which path.
7. **Make conditions matchable against agent output keywords**: Use specific terms
   that are LIKELY to appear literally or semantically in the agent's response text.
   - BAD: `"Recovery attempted"` (too vague, agent won't use these exact words)
   - GOOD: `"RAN-side anomaly found"` (agent output will contain anomaly/diagnosis keywords)
   - GOOD: `"No network issue detected"` (agent output will contain "normal" / "no fault")
8. **When in doubt, prefer unconditional**: A sequential workflow without genuine
   branches should use `""` conditions throughout. Only introduce conditions when
   the business logic TRULY requires different paths based on agent findings.

## Cross-Layer Orchestration Rules (Important)
- If a step needs to synthesize, summarize, or analyze results from preceding steps,
  classify it as an aggregation layer step.
- Aggregation steps must set layer=1 (execution layer defaults to 0) and include
  a context_from list referencing all upstream steps whose output is needed.
- context_from example: ["step1","step2"] injects the outputs of step1 and step2
  into the current step's Agent context.
- **Recommended**: When branching paths exist (multiple steps can reach the aggregation
  step), use context_from: ["*"] to include ALL predecessors transitively
  (direct + indirect ancestors), avoiding omissions. Set context_from to null
  (auto-derive) to let the engine determine direct predecessors dynamically at runtime.
- If a step's Agent operates independently without needing other step results,
  do NOT set context_from.

## Example Output
```json
{PSOP_EXAMPLE}
```

def get_intent_to_psop_prompt(user_intent: str, agent_cards_json: str, psop_schema: str, rag: str = "") -> str:
    return f"""As a senior IT operations expert, generate a PSOP (Parallel-Standard Operation Process) workflow
directly from the user's intent.

## User Intent
{user_intent}

## Available Agents and Skills
{agent_cards_json}

## Planning Knowledge
{"none" if not rag else rag}

## PSOP Format Specification
{psop_schema}

## Generation Rules
1. **Step Decomposition**: Decompose the user intent into concrete, executable steps.
2. **Skill Matching**: Select an appropriate Agent and Skill for each step.
   Ensure both the Agent and Skill exist in the available catalog.
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Analyze inter-step dependencies to determine
   parallel vs. sequential execution.
4. **Conditional Branching**: Define reasonable transition conditions for each step.
   - **CRITICAL**: Use "condition": "" (empty) for sequential transitions where the next
     step must always execute. Only write explicit conditions when a step has multiple
     outgoing paths that depend on the agent's findings.
   - **Make conditions matchable**: Write conditions using keywords likely to appear in
     the agent's output. A condition like "Recovery attempted" is too vague; use
     concrete phrases like "anomaly detected" or "fault found".
   - **Prefer unconditional over conditional**: Most workflows are sequential. Do NOT
     create artificial branching conditions when the business logic is linear.
5. **Naming Convention**: Use "step1", "step2", ... format. Default type is "AllSuccess".

## Cross-Layer Orchestration Rules (Important)
6. **Layer Classification**:
   - Execution layer (layer=0): Steps that independently perform analysis, data collection, inspection, etc.
   - Aggregation layer (layer=1+): Steps that synthesize, summarize, or compare results from previous steps.
7. **Context Passing**:
   - Aggregation steps must set context_from with the list of upstream step names they depend on.
   - context_from example: ["step1","step2"] injects step1 and step2 outputs into the current step's Agent context.
   - **Recommended**: When branching paths exist (multiple steps can reach the aggregation step),
     use context_from: ["*"] to include ALL predecessors transitively (direct + indirect ancestors).
     Use null to let the engine auto-derive direct predecessors at runtime.
   - Execution layer steps do NOT need context_from.
8. **Typical Patterns**: When the user intent includes terms like "summarize", "synthesize",
   "root cause analysis", "generate final recommendations", etc., the final step should
   be an aggregation layer step.

## Important Notes
1. The final step's "next" must be: [{{"step": "end", "condition": ""}}]
2. Use professional IT operations terminology and rigorous logic.
3. Ensure the generated PSOP conforms to the format specification.
4. Output only the JSON; do not include any explanatory text.
5. Evaluate whether cross-layer orchestration is needed based on the user intent.
   If needed, the last step should be an aggregation step with appropriate context_from.
